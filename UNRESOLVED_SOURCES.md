# UNRESOLVED_SOURCES.md — sources that need manual resolution

> Every series from `data_sources.md` that could not be pulled (unverifiable
> TimeSeriesID / PX-Web path / FRED code / download URL, a scrape that failed or
> returned the wrong-looking data, no stable endpoint found) is logged here with
> enough detail to resolve it manually. Per `INGEST_TASK.md §0`: a logged gap is
> cheap; a silently-wrong series is expensive. This file is the agenda for the
> manual resolution session — keep it current as ingestion is built out, don't
> batch it to the end.

Format per entry:

```
## <series name> (<cadence>) — <source>
- Access mode attempted: package / scrape / excel
- What I tried: <package + series id, or URL + query, or download URL>
- What happened: <error / wrong-looking data / no stable URL / ID unverifiable>
- What I need from you: <the specific missing piece>
```
